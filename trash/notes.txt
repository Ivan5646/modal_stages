1) change state on click?
2) next back buttons
3) clickable stage numbers

So just follow the react_steps structure?


remembering the problem... The problem is how do I keep the state in top component if in buttons comp there were click handlers that were supposed to change the state, they could change it if the state was inside buttons comp of course, but otherwise? What I need is to keep the state in the top comp, so for ex. to change the displayed stage which is different comp. 

Problems
- onclick event inside one component event hanlder inside another?
- calling inside component (but not inside any component's function) console.log("initial state"); giving Uncaught SyntaxError: Inline Babel script: Unexpected token 
newboston Boileplate
- when changing js file have to rerun build command and restsrt server wtf?


Problems Solved
- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
console.log(stage);
next() {
console.log("next clicked");
//this.setState({ stage: this.state.stage + 1});  // increment state.stage
var stage = this.state.stage; // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
console.log(stage);
}

Solved by putting     this.next = this.next.bind(this);    in component constructor


react_steps https://github.com/Srdjan/react-multistep  App structure 
stepone, steptwo, ... => index.js && miltustep.js => ../../index.js => app.js => index.html

Multistep.js is the top comp which contains state... it controlls button


Multisteps is the one way, every step has its own class with the same structure (repeatedly... wtf?). I need "do not repeat yourself" of course, and it seems that app uses React in a shitty way since its every stage is a new class... Well I can try this way anyway, because I have not found better app and I have not figured out how to do better myself.



On React learning path
Seems like with steps is too tough for me?.. 
Bucky has too simple tutorials...? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWzA2Ir1ZJc&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBuKtLgPR_zWYnrwv-JllpA&index=9  refs
Ok, seems like Bucky's tuts has some good points at the end, so probably try their code out and understand what is happening in code. Yeah but no scource code available so I will have to spend a hell of a lot of time typing it? And in the end it will turn out to be a crappy tut, becasue now I can't undersstand it thoroughly.


------Bucky Tutorials Branch-----
the only source code?
https://github.com/buckyroberts/Source-Code-from-Tutorials/blob/master/React/005_events.html

So Bucky's tuts has old syntax...

App Structure.
Comment comp is a child comp. Board is a parent comp.

Problem
- Uncaught TypeError: this.props.updateCommentText is not a function. Well how to pass a function as props from parent comp to child comp. It is possible?
? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32317154/react-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-setstate-of-undefined <button onClick={this.delta.bind(this)}>+</button>

- updateCommentText={this.updateComment}  Cannot read property 'updateComment' of undefined, no error if "this" replaced by class Name
- webpack scss to css. I will leave it for later. For now just use css.
