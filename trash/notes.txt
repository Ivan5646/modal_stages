1) change state on click?
2) next back buttons
3) clickable stage numbers

So just follow the react_steps structure?


remembering the problem... The problem is how do I keep the state in top component if in buttons comp there were click handlers that were supposed to change the state, they could change it if the state was inside buttons comp of course, but otherwise? What I need is to keep the state in the top comp, so for ex. to change the displayed stage which is different comp. 

Problems
- onclick event inside one component event hanlder inside another?
- calling inside component (but not inside any component's function) console.log("initial state"); giving Uncaught SyntaxError: Inline Babel script: Unexpected token

- when changing js file have to rerun build command and restsrt server wtf?


Problems Solved
- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
console.log(stage);
next() {
console.log("next clicked");
//this.setState({ stage: this.state.stage + 1});  // increment state.stage
var stage = this.state.stage; // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'state' of undefined
console.log(stage);
}

Solved by putting     this.next = this.next.bind(this);    in component constructor


react_steps https://github.com/Srdjan/react-multistep  App structure 
stepone, steptwo, ... => index.js && miltustep.js => ../../index.js => app.js => index.html

Multistep.js is the top comp which contains state... it controlls button
